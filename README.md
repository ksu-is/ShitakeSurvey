Application Development:
Project Idea: Shitake-survey Analysis tool
October 18, 2019
	I currently work at Mellow Mushroom in Sandy Springs.  I would like to develop a guest sentiment/survey analysis for customers.  My Mellow Mushroom has one already, but its not the greatest in the world.  I would like to build one so I can see what all goes into coding this type of application.  The survey will have up to 5 questions, and not every customer will see every question.  Depending on their dining experience, they may only see a select few.  One example of this would be if a customer was simply picking up a to go order.  For someone picking up an order, they may not need to be asked if they were offered a desert or appetizer.  
	The people that will be using this survey, would be any customer that placed an order, either at the store or over the phone.  I would also like to involve a bounce back component, that will include a $5 off or free appetizer on the next visit for taking the survey.  The customer will be given a unique code that will reference their receipt.  It is important to ask enough questions to get some data, but not so many that no one ever makes it to the end of the survey.  The survey will include mostly questions that can be answered on a scale of 1-5.  The scale would be, very satisfied, satisfied, indifferent, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied.  Thatâ€™s just an example.  I would like the program to be able to pick out good vs. bad comments made on the open-ended questions.    
	The establishment will use the data collected to help improve the experience of the customer.  This data will be helpful for both food quality and the quality of service the staff is giving the customers.  I am not sure how many people a project like this will take.  I would say 2 probably, but 1 might be able to do it.  I hope you think this is a decent project.  Thank you.
